//iterate over the array, using a for loop. We need to track the length of the array fo we don't overshoot, so we'll use the length as a constraint, and increment our contol variable(usually 'i') so that we can stop the loop
//inside we'll create local variables
//as we loop, each number in the array will add to the sum
// at the end of the loop we will ise the sume to divide by the length, which will give us the average
